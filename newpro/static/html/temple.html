Araikasu Amman shrine is found only in Rathnamangalam. The goddess in the form of Parvathi, graces in a sitting form, with four hands, and adorned with snake crown with a crescent on top.Deivanai Amman is not an incarnation of Shakthi or Lakshmi or Saraswathi, she is an ordinary woman of Tamilnadu, who transformed into Goddess by her incredible virginity. This fact may be amazing.
