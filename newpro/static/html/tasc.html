<ul>
<li>

Thiruvalluvar Government Arts College, Rasipuram, situated in a sprawling campus of 40.05 acres of land has been providing quality education since 11th July 1968. The college was started with five pre-university courses. Within a year it was upgraded with degree classes in order to provide education to the students of the nearby villages who were economically backward. Though the college is located in a rural area it caters to the needs of the students who belong to the lower strata of the society. Local philanthropists were generous enough to donate liberally to the establishment of the college.

The college is functioning in an excellent manner, paving way to the introduction of many new courses. It is trying its level best to introduce the latest courses to the benefit of the students. The college is looking for ways and means to develop further in all possible dimensions. The enhancement of quality is consistently attained by providing better facilities to the student community, introducing new avenues and programmes for their better growth.
